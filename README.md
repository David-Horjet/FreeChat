# FreeChat: MERN Stack Chat Application
## Introduction

FreeChat is a web chat application built with **MongoDb**, **Express**, **React** and **NodeJs**. I used **ReactJs** for the client side and **NodeJs** for the server-side. The Real-time chatting feature is also developed using [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/).

## Features

FreeChat provides users with the following features
<br/>
* Authentication using **JWT Tokens**
* A **Free Chatting System** which can be used by anyone using the application to send messages to any user on FreeChat.
* A **Private Chat** functionality where users can chat with other users privately.
* Accessibility to private and public profile pages
